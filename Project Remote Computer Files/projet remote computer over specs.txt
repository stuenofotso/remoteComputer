Project Remote Computer
 
 Project remote computer over Wi-Fi is a tools that offer the possibility to manage his computer with android phone over Wi-Fi.
Have you ever been spent much time in front of your computer waiting for a task to be completed; for a Skype message/response on anything else? Have you ever stopped using your computer for many times because your screen has been broken or your mouse/keyboard didn't work?
Remote computer is a project started because I think that all what we need from a computer in other to manage it is the cpu, memory and a way to connect them. We can then provide a technology to manage those form everything such as phone, tablet, TV,...
In other to concretize this idea, I will start by creating an application client/server in java and android which can permit to everybody everywhere to manage his computer (see what is displayed on the screen, hear sound, use the mouse and the keyboard) from android terminal.
I think this project can be much more than what was previously describe; so if you have any Idea or if you just want to correct what I've said; please feel free to perform it.
