have you ever been spent much time infront of your computer waiting for a task to be completed; for a skype message/response on anything else?
have you ever stopped using you computer for many times because your screen has been broken or your mouse/keybord didn't work?

remote computer is a project started because I think that all what we need from a computer in other to manage it is the cpu, memory and a way to connect them. We can then provide a technology to manage those form every thing such as phone, tablet, tv, ...

In other to croncretize this idea, I started by create an application client/server in java and android which can permit to everybody everywhere to manage his computer (see what is displayed on the screen, hear sound, use the mouse and the keyboard) from android terminal.

-	Automatic Server location
-	You can select the computer screen area to display directly from the android application and change intuitively ( by sliding your finger on the screen )
-	You can increase or decrease the zoom on an item in the capture area. (e.g. select a text box and zoom to read clearly )
-	You can right click or left click
-	you can hear your Computer speakers directly onto your mobile while viewing and handling the keyboard and mouse devices
-	Give your tips, comments, criticisms and issues with the community of users directly through the application.
-	 Capture unique moments through screenshots.
-	handle mouse scroll (use volume up and down button)
-	Take an image through your smartphone and save it directly to your PC
-	drag and drop components
