have you ever been spent much time infront of your computer waiting for a task to be completed; for a skype message/response on anything else?
have you ever stopped using you computer for many times because your screen has been broken or your mouse/keybord didn't work?

remote computer is a project started because I think that all what we need from a computer in other to manage it is the cpu, memory and a way to connect them. We can then provide a technology to manage those form every thing such as phone, tablet, tv, ...

In other to croncretize this idea, I started by create an application client/server in java and android which can permit to everybody everywhere to manage his computer (see what is displayed on the screen, hear sound, use the mouse and the keyboard) from android terminal.

I think this project can be much more than what it is now; so if you have any Idea or if you just want to correct what I've done; please feel free to perform this.

Let's go!
